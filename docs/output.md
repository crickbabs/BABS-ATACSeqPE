#### Sample-level results

`align/replicateLevel/` and `align/sampleLevel/` have exactly the same directory structure. The only difference is that multiple libraries sequenced from the same sample will be merged in the `replicateLevel/` directory, and all the replicates associated with a sample will be merged in the `sampleLevel/` directory. The main reasoning behind merging the replicates at the sample-level was to improve the coverage in order to call more accurately defined and robust peaksets. This may have some downsides especially if there is high variability amongst the replicates. However, for the most part it seems to work quite well.

### `genome/`

Genome-specific files required by selected processes in the pipeline.

### `igv/`

An [IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/) session file called `igv_session.xml` will be created at the end of the pipeline. This avoids having to load all the data individually into IGV for visualisation. Once installed, open IGV, go to `File > Open Session` and select the `igv_session.xml` file for loading.

File paths in the IGV session file will be set as absolute paths to the directory containing the results. If you prefer to load the data over the web you can just replace the relevant portion of the file path with a link in the session file.

The reference genome fasta file will be soft-linked to the `genome/` directory, and by default this will be set as the genome for the IGV session. If you prefer to use an in-built genome provided by IGV just change the file path to the name of the IGV genome e.g. mm10 or hg19.   

### `pipeline/`

Nextflow provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to trouble-shoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage. Default reports generated by the pipeline are `BABS-ATACSeqPE_report.html`, `BABS-ATACSeqPE_timeline.html`, `BABS-ATACSeqPE_trace.txt` and `BABS-ATACSeqPE_dag.dot`.
