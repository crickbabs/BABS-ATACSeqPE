## Pipeline configuration

Various config files are provided with the pipeline. Some contain pipeline-specific parameters for use with Nextflow in order to increase the flexibility and portability of the pipeline, and others contain parameters required for specific processes.

## Software configuration

Depending on where and how you would like to run the pipeline, Nextflow needs to be configured to use the [required software](https://github.com/crickbabs/BABS-ATACSeqPE/blob/master/docs/config.md#software-requirements).

### Conda

This is the easiest, most hassle-free and portable way of running the pipeline. A custom [Conda environment file](https://github.com/crickbabs/BABS-ATACSeqPE/blob/master/environment.yaml) is provided with the pipeline for those that wish to run the pipeline on another system without having to painstakingly install all of the software and associated dependencies. This will require an internet connection on the command-line, and installation of [Anaconda or Miniconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html). Nextflow will rather amazingly create a temporary Conda environment by downloading and installing all of the required software before execution of the pipeline. **NOTE: This could take up to 45 minutes.**  

It is also possible to create a permanent copy of the Conda environment for recurrent use and Nextflow can be configured accordingly, however this wont be outlined here.

A [Conda config file](https://github.com/crickbabs/BABS-ATACSeqPE/blob/master/conf/conda.config) can be found in the `conf/` directory. By default, the pipeline will be executed using the `slurm` job submission system. You will need an account to use the HPC cluster on CAMP if you want to run this at The Francis Crick Institute. If you prefer to run the pipeline locally in serial just replace `executor = 'slurm'` to `executor = 'local'` in the Conda config file. However, the pipeline may take a very long time to complete and this is only recommended for testing purposes.  

Before the submission of each Nextflow process the `conda` command will need to be available on the command-line to activate the Conda environment. If you are not running the pipeline at The Francis Crick Institute you will need to edit `beforeScript = 'module purge && ml Anaconda2/5.1.0'` in the config file to load/use Conda.

**When running the pipeline just specify `-profile conda` in order to use this configuration.**

### Environment modules

If you are running this pipeline at The Francis Crick Institute all of the required software can be loaded with the environment module system on CAMP. A [module config file](https://github.com/crickbabs/BABS-ATACSeqPE/blob/master/conf/babs_modules.config) specifying the software modules to load has been been created for this purpose. If you want to change the versions of software just edit this file before running the pipeline, however, this may require some testing to make sure the Nextflow processes requiring the software can still be run with the same command-line parameters.  

By default, the pipeline will be executed using the `slurm` job submission system. You will need an account to use the HPC cluster on CAMP if you want to run this at The Francis Crick Institute. If you prefer to run the pipeline locally in serial just replace `executor = 'slurm'` to `executor = 'local'` in the module config file. However, the pipeline may take a very long time to complete and this is only recommended for testing purposes.

**When running the pipeline just specify **`-profile babs_modules`** in order to use this configuration.**

### Standard

If you really need to run the pipeline in serial you can specify `-profile standard` when running the pipeline. This is the most basic profile and will require all the software to be available at the command-line. The processes will be submitted in serial on the logged in environment.

## Software requirements

The software below is required to run the pipeline:

### R libraries

The following R libraries may need to be installed if unavailable. You can test this be loading the `R` module (if required), typing `R` at the command prompt and attempting to load the packages below e.g. `> library(optparse)` and so on. The pipeline assumes the correct R library path is set in order find the installed packages. If not, you can set this in the `.Rprofile` file in the user home directory or add a line which extends the `R` [libPaths](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/libPaths.html) in the executable R scripts in the `bin/` directory.

### Linux utilities

Standard linux tools including `cut`, `awk`, `sort`, `mv`, `touch`, `echo`, `mkdir`, `paste`, `cp`, `ln`, `grep` are also used throughout the pipeline.
